# Predicting-Electricity-Consumption-in-the-United-States
Here I've uploaded a project I worked on for FMPH 221 (Biostatistical Methods I) during Fall 2018. I think it does a good job of illustrating scenarios where linear models can be good for inference and making predictions, as well as scenarios where they might not be. It also illustrates the rigorous analysis that should be involved when using these types of models.

If trying to replicate the results, please change the working directory that is specified by the function setwd(). $\Delta Y_{t}$
